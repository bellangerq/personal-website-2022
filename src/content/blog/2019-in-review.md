As 2019 comes to its end, it's the perfect time to jump back in this year to highlight what happened to me personally and professionally.

## Bordeaux

Because of the job market, we moved in Laval (France, not Canada) at the beginning of 2018. After more than one year living there, we finally moved back in Bordeaux in May and it was so refreshing! The city is way cooler and has a lot of activities, the tech community is big and active and we already knew people here (previous colleagues, friends and family). We can say we feel good in this city.

## HelloAsso

In June, I got a new position as front-end developer at [HelloAsso](https://helloasso.com) where I still work. I'm super happy about that. There is a great tech team, the atmosphere is really friendly and we're working hard to leverage the power of associations we believe in.

## Vue.js

Technically speaking, I leveled up my [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) skills. While my previous experience taught be the basis of Vue.js applications through [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), the current one is really pushing it to the next level for me. I am now less dependent and more confortable with a lot of new notions and concepts.

## Accessibility

The thing I am the most happy with is accessibility. It was a goal for me to learn web accessibility this year. My mantra was: "Don't ship unaccessible code anymore". To enhance my skills, I browsed many blog posts, read a book ("[Inclusive Design Patterns](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns)" by Heydon Pickering) and attend a conference ([Paris Web](https://www.paris-web.fr/)). I tried as much as I can to apply everything that I learn in my daily job and to raise awareness among my colleagues.

## What to expect in 2020?

There are so much things I want to learn in the web development area. But here are the goals I want to accomplish the most:

- **Become an accessibility reference**: I know things about accessibility. But I want to know more things! This could be done in attending courses and taking official certifications, talking about it (I had my first talk in French in late November for [Human talks](https://noti.st/bellangerq/Qm6hqL/introduction-a-laccessibilite-web)!) and educating people around me.
- **Understand React**: React always appeared to me as a complex framework compared to Vue.js. That's why I never tried it until last month. In 2020, I want to dive deeper in it to be able to fluently read React code and to play with it.
- **Learn how to built a WordPress (WP) theme**: "_WordPress is not for developers lolz_". Since I started my career, I always heard this kind of bad jokes about WP. I only used it as a user but never as a developer because I don't know PHP. I'm sure it's a great tool and I want to create a WordPress theme this year. It will allow me to get to know the environment and ecosystem and to forge my own opinion about it.

I hope 2019 was also successful for you on every level. Happy new year everyone! ðŸŽ‰
